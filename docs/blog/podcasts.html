        As soon as I decided to make my own website, I knew that, somehow, somewhere on there, I had to list my podcast recommendations. I try really hard not to become the stereotypical “um, actually” podcast jerk, but I also don’t hide from the fact that I really enjoy them and learn a lot from them. So, for this post, I wanted to talk about some podcasts that I feel have made me a smarter person.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Now, I want to take a second to clarify what I mean when I use the term “smart”. I usually try to avoid using the word at all because it’s often taken to refer to some inherent intelligence that some people just have and others just don’t. I don’t really believe in that sort of thing. What I’m talking about here is a learned intelligence, something that no one is born with but that everyone can gain through the right sources. When I say these podcasts made me smarter, I don’t just mean that they gave me new trivia facts to obnoxiously spew at my friends. I mean that they showed me new ways of looking at the world and taught me how to see things in a different, more nuanced way. I genuinely feel that I would not get as much out of life today had I not started listening to these shows.

      <p>
        <em>The Indicator</em> is spin-off of NPR’s <em>Planet Money</em>. It drops a new episode every weekday telling a short story about the economy. Economics is a topic that’s easy to write off as dull and academic, but the hosts have a contagious enthusiasm that makes the show fun to listen to. It’s one of the shows where I let unplayed episodes pile up so I can listen to them all at once the next time I have a long car ride.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        If there’s one broad takeaway from <em>The Indicator</em>, it’s that the world is complicated and, especially when it comes to the economy, nothing is as certain as most people say it is. The episode topics jump all over the place, from the treasury yield curve to student debt to why we still use the QWERTY keyboard layout. But throughout it all there’s a fairly common thread of someone making a bold, eye-catching claim and then the actual data not totally lining up with that claim. In almost every episode, there’s some point where one of the hosts cautions that they’re only going off a limited amount of evidence and there’s a lot that people still don’t know what’s really going on. That’s something that, while it would make a pretty terrible headline, is almost always the case when it comes to news stories about the economy.

      <p>
        <em>Invention</em> is a relatively young podcast from HowStuffWorks and iHeartMedia. In it, co-hosts Robert Lamb and Joe McCormick explore the histories of various technologies. It’s a concept that could have easily become just another trivia podcast about who came up with what idea in which year, but it ends up being something much deeper than that. Beyond just discussing the basic who, what, where, when, and how of these inventions, Lamb and McCormick spend a large amount of their time discussing the why questions. Why wasn’t the wheel invented earlier? Why were people so obsessed with death rays? Why did anyone ever bother making a museum?
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Through these questions, these charismatic and witty hosts turn every episode into an exploration of the human experience – and how fundamentally that experience is impacted by such basic, everyday inventions as walls, roads, and toilets. It sounds a bit pretentious, and sometimes it definitely is, but in a sort of light-hearted, tongue-in-cheek way that makes it tolerable. In any case, <em>Invention</em> has made me think a lot more about all the different pieces of technology I take for granted, and how different my world would be without them.

        <em>Throughline</em> is another NPR podcast, and a pretty new one, having aired its first episode in February of 2019. It describes itself as the show “where we go back in time, to understand the present.” Hosts Ramtin Arablouel and Rund Abdelfatah interview historians and have conversations that explore the hidden history behind modern news stories. Past topics have included America’s first ever presidential Impeachment, Vladimir Putin’s rise to power, and how Evangelical Christianity became synonymous with right-wing politics.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        <em>Throughline</em>’s secret ingredient is the tone of its hosts. Arablouel and Abdelfatah bring a genuine curiosity to their reporting. When they ask questions to scholars or other reporters, you get the sense that what they are learning is as surprising and confusing to them as it is to you, the listener. Rather than feeling like a lecture, it feels like you’re riding along with these two and sharing in their journey through these forgotten parts of history. It’s taught me to be more curious about the backstory behind current events, and what that backstory can teach us about the path forward.
