        <p>Hi, I'm Jordan! There's a lot of different words that describe my identity, but my favorites are husband, skeptic, and humanist. During the work day, I'm a software engineer at Capital One, helping build software for small business owners. Otherwise, I cook, play D&D, and listen to a <i>lot</i> of podcasts. I'm also writing a fantasy novel!</p>
        <p>If you're curious about my job experience, you can find my resum√© <a href="./resume.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>, or see my LinkedIn profile <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/jkagelmayer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
