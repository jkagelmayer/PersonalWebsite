      <h3>The Three Games That Made Me Love Video Games Again</h3>
      <h4 class="subtitle">
        In which I pay my respects to Bethesda, Campo Santo, and From Software.
      </h4>

      <p>
        College was the end of a lot of things for me. It was the end of living with my parents and siblings. It was the end of having to go to church on Sundays. It was the end of being anywhere near any of my high school friends. But when my school life went from eight ours of class each day to three and seeing my partner went from a fifteen-minute drive to a five-hour bus ride, I lost something else too. I stopped playing video games.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Looking back, I’m not sure if I was actually that busy my Freshman year or if I just wanted to fit the stereotype of the too-busy-to-breathe engineering major. But in any case, I stopped letting myself play games. It wasn’t like I stopped having free time at all – I still hung out with classmates and went to the movies and watched all six seasons of <em>Community</em>. There was just something that told me that I was in college now and I was an engineering student and engineering students can’t waste their time playing video games.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        And that mindset persisted for a good two and a half years. It wasn’t until the second semester of my Junior year that I started to question it. I remembered how much I used to love video games in high school, how much fun it was to sit back at the end of the day or the week and just lose myself in a virtual world. That, combined with a healthy realization that I didn’t need to feel guilty for letting myself relax a little, encouraged me to try it out again. I re-installed Steam on my computer, got access to my brother’s library, picked three titles that looked interesting, and installed them.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        At the time, I was just sort of shrugging my way into it. I fully expected to play each game for a bit, think, “Yeah, that was kind of fun, I guess,” and then go back to being the oh-so-busy engineering major I had always felt like I was supposed to be. Instead, those three games completely reignited my love of that hobby and I never looked back. And the thing is, having played plenty more since then, I can say there are lots of other games that probably wouldn’t have gotten me hooked in the same way. So I wanted to take some time to think about why these three did it and what specifically each game did to remind me how special video games really are.

      <h4>Dishonored</h4>
      <p>
        <em>Dishonored</em> is a grim, stealthy immersive sim that has you skulking about a dieselpunk city dispatching various targets. You play as Corvo Attano, a silent protagonist who starts the game as the bodyguard of the Empress of this fictional nation. However, in the very first mission you are framed for her murder and forced to work with a resistance group and a spooky Warlock-patron-type being called the Outsider in order to overthrow the new government and get your revenge.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Perhaps the most essential piece of <em>Dishonored</em>'s gameplay is its emphasis on choice. There are plenty of games that let the player choose between being a stealthy assassin or a rampaging barbarian, but <em>Dishonored</em> goes deeper than this. Though the missions do have a set order and set objectives, there are practically limitless ways to go about reaching each of your targets. Will you stay high up, scaling walls and rooftops to avoid being seen by enemies on the ground? Will you dash between cover, picking off guards one-by-one and hiding their bodies in dumpsters? Or maybe you’d rather use your magical powers (courtesy of your buddy the Outsider) to possess a rat and crawl through the pipes and vents in order to reach your victim’s bedroom. And once you get there, you have the choice to either kill them or pursue another (often more difficult) non-lethal option.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        <em>Dishonored</em> also remembers your decisions, beyond the binary “good thing or bad thing” systems that many games employ. The game’s “chaos” system will remember not just whether or not you kill your targets, but how many guards you kill along the way and how often you’re spotted and just generally how much of a ruckus you cause. All of this will affect the world and the story: more killing means more plague-infected enemies, different relationships with NPCs, and ultimately a different ending.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        There are a lot of other good things I could say about <em>Dishonored</em>. The soundtrack is incredible and truly creepy, the sound design makes spells and kills immensely satisfying, and the progression system has upgrades that are actually exciting. But to me, the way the game allows for and keeps track of your choices is what really made it stick. It’s a really special type of fun that I hadn’t realized I’d missed until I played this game. As I made my way through the final mission, I didn’t feel like I was reading the final chapter of a book or watching the series finale of a TV show; this was the culmination of <em>my</em> story and <em>my</em> choices. Even if <em>Dishonored</em> isn’t really a sandbox game, the myriad of options presented to me with each mission and the way the world and characters reacted to my decisions made me feel like it was my own unique story. It was fun, engaging, and, by the end of it, remarkably satisfying.

      <h4>Firewatch</h4>
      <p>
        <em>Firewatch</em> is a small indie game where you play as a fire lookout for a conifer-filled national park. There are elements of puzzles and exploration, but the game is primarily about telling a story. As you play, you slowly uncover various strange things and end up become a sort of detective.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        The first few minutes are spent telling the story of Henry’s life leading up to his job as a fire lookout, allowing you to decide certain things along the way. As you play, you frequently communicate with Henry’s supervisor, Delilah, via a walkie-talkie, and you’re always given multiple dialogue options. This lets you make a series of small decisions about this person you’re playing as. What was the first thing you said to your wife? Did you have a big dog or a small dog? How flirty are you with Delilah? None of these choices affect the overarching plot in any significant way, but they make you really connect to Henry in a way that you often won’t connect to other video game characters.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        When I think about why <em>Firewatch</em> engaged me so much, not just in itself but in video games as a whole, the first thing that comes to mind is how close I felt to Henry. Lots of games have you controlling some fictional character and often that experience feels very external, not that far from watching a character on a movie screen. <em>Firewatch</em> showed me that, when done right, a game could really make me feel like I was the character, even without letting me really do anything to change the story or world.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        For me, that changed the entire game. I wasn’t just seeing a story, I was in it. When Henry was in danger, I got scared – not for some random fire lookout, but for me the fire lookout. When I discovered some disturbing or tragic plot twist, it didn’t feel like I was just watching it; it felt like it was really there, it was really happening. As a result, the emotions I felt were much more visceral and just felt more real. When I walked away from the game at the end of it all and I thought about the overarching themes, it wasn’t from some third-person analytical point of view. I was looking within myself, asking what I personally should take away from this whole experience.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Unlike <em>Dishonored</em>, <em>Firewatch</em> never really felt like it was letting my make my own story. But I also didn’t feel like I was just watching some other person go through everything that happened. I knew Henry – I <em>was</em> Henry. And everything that happened to Henry in that story happened to <em>me</em>. It was a really special sort of experience, and one that I’m happy to say many other games have since been able to give me.
