        There are a few of questions that show up pretty often in job interviews. So, I figured, why not just make a blog post in which I give my answers to those questions. Hopefully this makes some recruiter's job a little easier.

      <p class="interviewer">What is your greatest strength?</p>
      <p>I have mastered the art of flipping tables.</p>
      <br>
      <p class="interviewer">
        That doesn't seem like a very practical skill.
      </p>
      <p>You'd be surprised.</p>
      <br>
      <p class="interviewer">
        If you were an animal, what animal would you be and why?
      </p>
      <p>A beaver, because I'm very meticulous.</p>
      <br>
      <p class="interviewer">Hmm. Alright.</p>
      <p>
        Also, I don't bite off my own testicles, but until the 12th century, people thought I did.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p class="interviewer">
        Wait, did people really think beavers did that?</p>
      <p>
        They really did. The myth originated in Egypt. I read it on a Mental Floss article.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p class="interviewer">
        Huh. Okay, next question...why is a manhole cover round?
      </p>
      <p>Because a manhole is round.</p>
      <br>
      <p class="interviewer">Why is a manhole round?</p>
      <p>
        Oh, come on, you gotta admit that was — sorry. Uh, my guess is it’s because it keeps the cover from falling in; if it were a square or triangle you could turn it some way and drop it through the manhole, but not with a circle. It also makes sure there’s no “right” way to turn the cover in order to put it on.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p class="interviewer">
        Hmm. Okay, another brain teaser...how many tennis balls can fit inside a limousine?
      </p>
      <p>Twenty-four thousand, five-hundred and seventy-six.</p>
      <br>
      <p class="interviewer">Wait, how —</p>
      <p>
        It's just one of those things I know. I listen to a lot of podcasts.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p class="interviewer">Interesting. Moving on...what is your dream job.</p>
      <p>Dinosaur.</p>
      <br>
      <p class="interviewer">That's not a job.</p>
      <p>It is in my dreams.</p>
      <br>
      <p class="interviewer">Tell me about a time you exercised leadership.</p>
      <p>
        I’m always the one to start the applause. Always. I start, and everyone else follows. Name any type of event, I’m the first one to clap. Concert, conference presentation, comedy show, funeral – all of it.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p class="interviewer">Hmm. Now, tell me — wait, did you say funeral?</p>
      <p>
        Well, people don’t always follow. But you’ve got to be willing to take a chance sometimes. That’s the only way innovation happens.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p class="interviewer">
        Okay. Can you tell me where you were on the evening of Friday, February 1st?
      </p>
      <p>
        I don’t really see what this has to do with the job, but, uh, I was in my room, in my apartment. I was eating pizza and wings and watching video essays about game design. I kind of have this weekend tradition —
      </p>
      <br>
      <p class="interviewer">Can anyone else confirm that you were there?</p>
      <p>
        What? No, that’s the whole point, it’s sort of my chance to get away from people and —
      </p>
      <br>
      <p class="interviewer">So no one can confirm your alibi?</p>
      <p>
        No, I – wait, alibi? Alibi for what? What are you pulling out of that folder?
      </p>
      <br>
      <p class="interviewer">Do you know anything about the building in this photo?</p>
      <p>...</p>
      <br>
      <p class="interviewer">
        This building is a manufacturing plant that makes sports supplies – among other things, they make thousands of tennis balls every day. Do you recognize it?
      </p>
      <p>I think I want a lawyer.</p>
      <br>
      <p class="interviewer">Answer the question.</p>
      <p>I've nevers seen that building before in my life.</p>
      <br>
      <p class="interviewer">
        Bullshit! Between the hours of nine and eleven PM on February 1st, a massive collection of tennis balls was stolen from this building. Security cameras caught the culprit driving away in a black limousine with the stolen goods: EXACTLY twenty-four thousand, five-hundred and seventy-six tennis balls.
      </p>
      <p>...</p>
      <br>
      <p class="interviewer">What do you have to say for yourself?</p>
      <p>HIYA!</p>
      <br>
      <p class="interviewer">GAH! He flipped the table on me! He's getting away!</p>
      <br>
      <p style="font-size: 0.8rem">You'll never take me alive!</p>
      <br>
      <p class="interviewer">What are you two doing? Drive after him!</p>
      <br>
      <p><em>We can't! He's filled our squad cards with tennis balls!</em></p>
      <br>
      <p style="font-size: 0.8rem">Muahahahaha!</p>
      <br>
      <p class="interviewer">NOOOOOOOO!</p>
