      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hi! I'm a senior at Purdue University pursuing a triple-major in Aerospace Engineering, Computer Science, and Philosophy. I've served as President of the Purdue Chapter of <a href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/SGT/" target="_blank">Sigma Gamma Tau</a> and I also work as a <a href="https://www.purdue.edu/asc/si/" target="_blank">Supplemental Instruction</a> leader for Aero courses.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        What's left of my time is usually spent on some mixture of Dungeons &amp; Dragons, video games, writing, and baking. I also listen to podcasts pretty much constantly.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        My future career path will heavily depend on that of my fianc&eacute;, Bee, but my hope is to work on software development and testing within the aerospace industry. I'm particularly interested in trajectory simulation, control systems, and machine learning.
      </p>
