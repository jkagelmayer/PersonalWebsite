      <p>
        Okay, so technically this website hasn't existed long enough or seen enough traffic for anyone to have asked any questions, let alone frequently do so. However, I felt I should address some potential questions that might arise in the mind of someone looking at this website.
      </p>

        <li>
          This seems pretty basic. You're pretty new to website-building, aren't you?
          <p>
            Yup. This is my first time trying to put up any sort of website, aside from the drawing web app I made for a CS class Sophomore year. But also, basic is all this website needs. Its only real purpose is to present information and not be ugly, and I like to think I've done enough to achieve both of those goals.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          So why make a website at all?
          <p>
            It's something I wanted to learn to do, and I figured it might look good to have a personal URL on my resume.

        <li>
          Is this all it's ever going to be?
          <p>
            The main webpage, probably. I'll update it as I continue living and doing more things, but I want to keep it the way it is. I think anything else would be excessive. That said, I do plan to make a blog-type place where I can put up some of my writing and hopefully write some new things as well. But that would be a separate place.

          You're majoring in Aerospace Engineering and Computer Science; why?
          <p>
            I went into Purdue just planning on Aerospace, but once I realized I could afford a fifth year, I wanted to take advantage of that. Programming had always been something I wished I'd known but was never able to actually learn, and getting a degree in CS felt like a good way to force myself to learn it.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Do you have a preference between Aero and CS?
          <p>
            I don't like to have to choose one over the other. I'd be happy doing either, but my dream is to be able to combine them by working on code that's used in aerospace applications, such as simulations.
          </p>

        <li>
          Why the Philosophy minor?
          <p>
            I could probably come up with some persuasive argument about how it makes me better at &lt;insert job&gt;. Something about how it gives me a different perspective than my STEM classes. But really, I just like it.

          What's the secret to good, fluffy scrambled eggs?
          <p>
            Furious whisking. The more air bubbles you can get in there, the better. Also, don't be in a rush; use medium-low heat when you're cooking them.
