      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hi! I'm a senior at Purdue University pursuing Bachelor's degrees in Computer Science, Aerospace Engineering, and Philosophy. I'll be graduating in May of 2020 and I'm looking for full-time work. I've also served as President of the Purdue Chapter of <a href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/SGT/" target="_blank">Sigma Gamma Tau</a> and I work as a <a href="https://www.purdue.edu/asc/si/" target="_blank">Supplemental Instruction</a> leader for Aero courses.
      </p>

        What's left of my time is usually spent on some mixture of Dungeons &amp; Dragons, video games, writing, and baking. I also listen to podcasts pretty much constantly.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        When it comes to my career, I have a lot of different passions and skills. I love programming, but I also love being an engineer and solving problems. I also like to be creative and to talk to people. My hope is to find a job that lets me utilize all of those skills and really be my whole self - all while solving big, exciting problems.
      </p>
